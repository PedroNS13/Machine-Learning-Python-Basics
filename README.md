# Machine-Learning-Python-Basics
A foundational guide to Python for Machine Learning, covering NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib — essential tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in real-world ML workflows.

## Roadmap
The plan is divided into four weeks, focusing on different aspects of the libraries and culminating in a comprehensive final project.

### Week 1 - Fundamentals and Syntax
- Day 1: NumPy Basics (np.array, shape, dtype, indexing, basic vectorized operations)
- Day 2: Intermediate NumPy (np.mean, np.std, np.where, boolean masks, reshape, stack, concatenate)
- Day 3: Pandas Series & DataFrame (Creation, .head(), .info(), .describe(), .dtypes)
- Day 4: Reading and Writing Data (read_csv, read_excel, to_csv, to_json)
- Day 5: Indexing and Filters (.loc[], .iloc[], boolean filters)
- Day 6: Project 1 — Fictional Sales Analysis
- Day 7: Publish on GitHub (Project 1)
