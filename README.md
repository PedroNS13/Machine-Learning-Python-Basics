# Machine-Learning-Python-Basics
A foundational guide to Python for Machine Learning, covering NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib ‚Äî essential tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in real-world ML workflows.

## Roadmap
The plan is divided into four weeks, focusing on different aspects of the libraries and culminating in a comprehensive final project.

### Week 1 - Fundamentals and Syntax
- Day 1: NumPy Basics (np.array, shape, dtype, indexing, basic vectorized operations)
- Day 2: Intermediate NumPy (np.mean, np.std, np.where, boolean masks, reshape, stack, concatenate)
- Day 3: Pandas Series & DataFrame (Creation, .head(), .info(), .describe(), .dtypes)
- Day 4: Reading and Writing Data (read_csv, read_excel, to_csv, to_json)
- Day 5: Indexing and Filters (.loc[], .iloc[], boolean filters)
- Day 6: Project 1 ‚Äî Fictional Sales Analysis
- Day 7: Publish on GitHub (Project 1)
### Week 2 ‚Äî Manipulation, Grouping, and Transformations
- Day 8: Data Cleaning (.isnull(), .fillna(), .dropna(), .replace(), .astype())
- Day 9: Transformations (.apply(), .map(), .applymap() with lambda functions)
- Day 10: Grouping with groupby() (Mean by group, counts, custom aggregations)
- Day 11: Combining DataFrames (merge(), join(), concat())
- Day 12: Pivot, Melt, and Reshape (.pivot_table(), .melt(), .stack(), .unstack())
- Day 13: Project 2 ‚Äî Demographic Data Analysis
- Day 14: Publish on GitHub (Project 2)
### Week 3 ‚Äî Visualization with Matplotlib
Day 15: Basic Plots (plot(), scatter(), bar(), hist(), customization)
Day 16: Statistical Plots (boxplot(), pie(), violinplot())
Day 17: Subplots and Figures (plt.figure(), plt.subplot(), fig, ax = plt.subplots())
Day 18: Saving Plots (plt.savefig(), resolution, formats)
Day 19: Project 3 ‚Äî Real-World Dataset Visualization
Day 20: Refactor Project 3
Day 21: Publish on GitHub (Project 3)
### Week 4 ‚Äî Integration with ML + Portfolio Refinement
Day 22: Pandas ‚Üí NumPy Conversion (.to_numpy(), .values)
Day 23: Handling for ML (Normalization, standardization, .corr())
Day 24: Real-world dataset for preprocessing
Day 25: Creating Utility Functions (Automate tasks)
Day 26: Final Project ‚Äî Complete EDA + Preprocessing
Day 27‚Äì28: Refine the 4 Projects
Day 29: Complete Publication
Day 30: Post on LinkedIn / Instagram

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ Projects
### Project 1: Fictional Sales Analysis
- I created a fictional sales dataset using NumPy.
- I performed various data manipulation operations using Pandas, such as filtering, grouping, and calculating statistics.
- The results were saved to a CSV file.
### Project 2: Demographic Data Analysis
- I used a public demographic dataset to explore and analyze population characteristics.
- I performed tasks such as data cleaning, aggregation, and normalization.
- I generated visualizations using Matplotlib to gain insights from the data.
### Project 3: Real-World Dataset Visualization
- I chose a real-world dataset to practice data visualization techniques.
- I created various types of plots to represent the data effectively and extract relevant information.
### Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing
- I conducted a complete exploratory data analysis on a dataset related to heart disease.
- I cleaned, preprocessed, and prepared the data for machine learning modeling tasks.
- This project demonstrates my ability to handle a data science problem from start to finish.

## üìà Learnings
- Throughout this 30-day challenge, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Efficient data manipulation and analysis with NumPy and Pandas.
- Creating compelling and informative data visualizations using Matplotlib.
- Preparing data for machine learning applications.
- Building a portfolio of data science projects.

## ü§ù Contribution
Feel free to explore my projects and provide feedback. I am open to suggestions and collaborations to improve my skills and expand my portfolio.
